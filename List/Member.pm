=head1 NAME

List::Member - PROLOG's member/2: return index of $x in @y.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use List::Member;
  my $target = 'bar';
  my @look_in = ('foo','baz','bar','etc');

  warn "It is a member of the list" if member('bar',@look_in) +1;
  warn "It is a member of the list" if member('bar',@look_in) >= 0;

  warn "It is not a member of list" if member('tikkumolam',@look_in) eq nota_member();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A tiny routine to achieve the same effect as PROLOG's C<member/2>.

Returns the index of supplied scalar in supplied array, or returns the
value of the package's C<$NEG> scalar.  This can be over-ridden for the case
when the target is the same as the default C<-1>:

	$List::Member::NEG = 'not_a_member';

In the above case, the first two example calls in the POD would need to be
updated.

=head1 EXPORT

	member

=head1 CHANGES

In version 0.02, C<member> returned C<undef> but documented C<-1>.
The documentation was correct, and the code has been updated.

=head1 THANKS

John Day and Michael D Black in Florida for pointing out bugs
