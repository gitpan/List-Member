List-Member version 0.42
========================

NAME
    List::Member - PROLOG's member/2: return index of $x in @y.

SYNOPSIS
      use List::Member;
      my $target = 'bar';
      my @look_in = ('foo','baz','bar','etc');

      warn "It is a member of the list" if member('bar',@look_in) +1;
      warn "It is a member of the list" if member('bar',@look_in) >= 0;

      warn "It is not a member of list" if member('tikkumolam',@look_in) eq nota_member();

DESCRIPTION
    A tiny routine to achieve the same effect as PROLOG's "member/2".

    Returns the index of supplied scalar in supplied array, or returns the
    value of the package's $NEG scalar. This can be over-ridden for the case
    when the target is the same as the default -1:

            $List::Member::NEG = 'not_a_member';

    In the above case, the first two example calls in the POD would need to
    be updated.

EXPORT
            member

CHANGES
    In version 0.02, "member" returned "undef" but documented -1. The
    documentation was correct, and the code has been updated.
