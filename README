List-Member version 0.42
========================

NAME
    List::Member - PROLOG's member/2: return index of $x in @y.

SYNOPSIS
      use List::Member;
      my $target = 'bar';
      my @look_in = ('foo','baz','bar','etc', 0);
      warn "It is a member of the list" if member('bar',@look_in) +1;
      warn "It is a member of the list" if member('bar',@look_in) >= 0;
      warn "It is a member of the list" if member('ar$',@look_in) >= 0;
      warn "Zero is a member of the list" if member('0',@look_in) >= 0;
      warn "It is not a member of list" if member('tikkumolam',@look_in) eq nota_member();

DESCRIPTION
    A tiny routine to achieve the same effect as PROLOG's "member/2".

    Returns the index of supplied scalar in supplied array, or returns the
    value of the package's $NEG scalar. This can be over-ridden for the case
    when the target is the same as the default -1:

            $List::Member::NEG = 'not_a_member';

    In the above case, the first two example calls in the POD would need to
    be updated.

EXPORT
            member

THANKS
    Thanks to Benoit Thillaye du Boulay in France, John Day and Michael D
    Black in Florida for pointing out bugs in the documentation, and to
    the Limbic~Region for pointing out the snivelling nits grumbling about
    the lack of support for 0, without filing a bug report.
